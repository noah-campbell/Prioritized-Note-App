# Prioritized Note-taking App

I started this project to practice making and manipulating arrays. Using JavaScript, I wanted to play around with pushing elements into an array, and populating the webpage with responsively designed cards displaying information from the array. The idea of a note taking app came later, and I added a priority selection that colorizes the notes for a more pleasant and intuitive design. My next project within this would be utilizing pop() to add a method of deleting completed notes.

## Getting Started

This was made with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Easily used by downloading, unzipping files, and running "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" within your command line, and viewing on "localhost:8000"
